Project Topic: Employees Burnout Analysis & Prediction
• Understanding Employee Burnout : Analysis and Predictive Modelling for Organizational Well-being.
• Here we analyze the Employees burnout with the help of given features .
• We train a model to analyze and predict the Employees Burnout.
Project Overview:
• Employee burnout is a critical issue that impacts both individual well-being and organizational performance
• This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of employee burnout within a specific organization (or multiple organizations) and develop a predictive model to forecast potential burnout cases.
• This project is important for organizations as it provides insights into the well-being of their employees, helps mitigate burnout-related issues, and creates a healthier work environment. 
End Users :
The end users may vary based on the context and scope of the project.
Some of the key stakeholders are :
• Human resources(HR) Department
• Management and Leadership Teams
• Organizational Development Specialists
• Organizational Executives and Decision- Makers
• Researchers and Academics
Modelling:
• Employees Burnout Analysis involves using various statistical and machine learning techniques to understand the relationships between different variables and predict burnout risk among employees.
• I have chosen to implement the Employees Burnout Analysis using the machine learning techniques or algorithms like Random Forest Regressor and Ada Boost Regressor.
• They provide an accuracy score between 80 to 90.
Results :
• This model can be able predict the overall prevalence of burnout among employees in the organization.
• By using Random Forest Regressor my model has an accuracy score in between 80 to 90.
• By using Ada Boost Regressor my model has an accuracy score of 77 near to 80 .
